**Features:**

- **Memory:** Stores context, preferences, and usage patterns down to table/column level. AI learns over time and surfaces semantic-layer updates, review-gated.

- **Rules:** Define instructions, terms, and guardrails with versioning and approval workflows. Git sync with auto-indexing of dbt, markdown, code, and more.

- **Observability:** Full visibility into agent traces, plans, guardrails, LLM judges, evals, and feedback — debug and improve the loop.

- **Dashboards & sharing:** Build and share dashboards instantly. Share conversations, saved queries, and analysis with your team.

- **Any LLM ↔ Any warehouse:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama ↔ Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, Redshift. Swap or mix without breaking workflows.

- **MCP:** Use from Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other AI clients while reliably tracking requests and data operations.

## Architecture

Bag of words acts as a **context-aware analytics layer** that connects to any database or service, works with any LLM, and enriches queries with docs, BI models, or code.

The architecture is fully flexible: plug in any data source, any model, and any interface — giving your team maximum freedom of choice, without sacrificing governance or reliability.

## Enterprise

For teams requiring advanced security, compliance, and governance:

- **SSO:** Google Workspace and OIDC-compatible identity providers
- **Self-hosted:** Deploy on your own infrastructure with full data control
- **RBAC:** Role-based access control for fine-grained permissions

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
We take data security and privacy seriously.  

### Telemetry
By default, Bag of words captures basic usage stats of self-hosted instances to a centralized server. The data helps us improve the product.

You can disable by setting in `bow-config.yaml`

```yaml
telemetry
  enabled: false
```

You can also disable the Intercom chat for support

```yaml
intercom
  enabled: false
```
